### About

Crafted this little game for a game design elective in the college days. 
It's nothing _too_ special, but I did enjoy developing it to run on a simple grid system.
Also, the bears are _a d o r a b l e_ and the music is quite pleasant \uD83C\uDFB5 

### Instructions

* Use the arrow keys to move
* Press **A** to shoot left and **D** to shoot right - shoot the bears
* If a bear is close enough it can attack you and you'll lose a heart
* Losing all your hearts will result in game-over

### Issues

* The bears continue to move after the game has ended
* Player character can occupy the same spaces as bears

### Strategies

* Avoid the edged of the screen as those are where the bears will spawn
