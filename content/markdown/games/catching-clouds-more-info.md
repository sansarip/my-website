### About

This was one of the first little Phaser games I made for a college elective about game 
design. It ended up being a pretty amusing game to create _and_ play. Give it a whirl!


### Instructions

* Move around by clicking and holding down the mouse button
* Accrue points as you move, and collecting white clouds also grants 100 points
* Catching white clouds will also increases the rate at which you gain points, _but_ will 
increase your size - up to a cap
* Watch out for the dark clouds - they can only move when you move, 
and if they get you it's game-over

### Strategies

* The edges of the screen are very dangerous as that's where the dark clouds spawn, 
so stay towards the center
* Collecting white clouds will increase your points and point-gain-rate, 
but it will make you a bigger target - choose wisely
  
### Issues

* Horizontal movement may not be apparent when there are no other objects on the screen, 
because the background doesn't have a horizontal gradient
* The music may not play upon game initialization, 
but it should play if you touch a dark cloud
