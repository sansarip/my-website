### About

Here be the final game I made for my game design elective; 
it's certainly the most polished of the like. The game concept is nothing new - 
typing games have been around since the dawn of Flash games. 
Nevertheless, you don't see typing games _too_ often, 
and this definitely was a joy to build and 
really quite fun to play. Certainly brings back memories \uD83D\uDE22 

### Strategies

* You don't really get penalized for mistyping, 
 so feel free to mash your keys \uD83D\uDE09 

### Issues

* If you finish typing a word when no viruses have spawned, 
you'll have to repeat the word you typed 

### Instructions

* Type the word at the center of the screen to squash the viruses
* No need to worry about caps, everything should be lowercase/case-insensitive
* If a virus crosses the bottom of the screen, you will lose a cyber heart
* Enemies will speed up linearly every minute, up to a maximum of 5 minutes
* Enemy spawn rate increases after 3 minutes
