## Containerization


I already knew a fair bit about VMs 
- enough to know that they could be painfully slow to start up and very resource intensive - 
so, when I first learned about LXD containers my mind was blown \uD83E\uDD2F! 
Luckily my career path has led me to the doorsteps of Docker, Kubernetes, and OpenShift, 
and now I'm well acquainted with them.
