## Functional Programming


Coming from an OOP background I was hesitant to embrace FP at first, 
but one thing quickly led to another and I found myself excitingly living the FP ways (aka the future!) 
Most of my FP experience comes from building full-stack Clojure/ClojureScript web apps. 
In doing so, I've become quite experienced with popular Clojure web tools and frameworks. 
Tools like Reagent, Re-Frame, Compojure/Ring, and many more! 
Check out my open-source [full-stack web application Leiningen template](https://clojars.org/yacwat/lein-template) 
to get a better feel for my work experience.
